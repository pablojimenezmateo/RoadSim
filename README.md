Road simulator
==================

######Brief description
This is a project that is part of my final Msc thesis. The goal is to simulate the behaviour of autonomous vehicles and optimize their
routes.

Currently the simulator is able to read a configuration file, and launch the agents at specific times inside the simulation.
